/**
 * The other default page nobody had replaced. In production an unhandled
 * render error showed Next's own screen, which says "Application error: a
 * client-side exception has occurred" and nothing else — no nav, no footer,
 * and no indication of whether money moved.
 *
 * Two things matter on this page and neither is the apology. Somebody who
 * hits an error mid-payment needs to be told plainly that a charge, if it
 * happened, stands on its own and is visible in the console — because the
 * webhook confirms a booking regardless of what this browser tab does. And
 * they need the digest, which is the only string that ties what they saw to
 * a line in the server logs.
 *
 * `error.message` is deliberately not shown. React replaces it with a
 * generic string in production anyway, and printing raw error text to a page
 * is how internals end up in screenshots.
