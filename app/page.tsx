            <details>
              <summary>Do I need to share my demat login?</summary>
              <p>
                No. You share a summary of your holdings before the call — never login credentials.
                There is no field anywhere on Landline that accepts one.
              </p>

            <details>
              <summary>Is this AI reading my portfolio?</summary>
              <p>
                No. A named person with market experience reads what you send and talks to you about
                it. Nothing on this platform generates an automated verdict on your holdings.

            <details>
              <summary>Do experts give stock tips?</summary>
              <p>
                No. Experts review your existing portfolio and approach. They do not recommend
                specific trades, and nothing said on a call is personalised investment advice.
              </p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Do I get anything in writing?</summary>
              <p>
                Your expert writes up what the session covered, and it sits in your console beside
                what you sent them. It is a record of what was discussed — not a recommendation, and
                not something to act on by itself.

            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>What is the difference between the packages?</summary>
              <p>
                An individual call is one conversation. The quarterly and annual passes are
                unlimited calls with any expert across {MEMBERSHIP_TIERS.quarterly.days} or{" "}
                {MEMBERSHIP_TIERS.annual.days} days, so you can come back as your position changes
                rather than saving everything for one session.

            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>What happens to my portfolio details afterwards?</summary>
              <p>
                They go only to the expert you booked, and are deleted {INTAKE_RETENTION_DAYS} days
                after the call — along with whatever your expert wrote up afterwards.

                Email <a href={`mailto:${CONTACT_EMAIL}`}>{CONTACT_EMAIL}</a> within 24 hours and we

                from. One person on the other end who has read what you hold, for {SLOT_MINUTES}
                minutes. Then it hangs up &mdash; nothing renews and nobody follows up.

            Was "You book. They look. You decide."

            "Look" was the problem. Every other line on this site says READ —
            the audit section, step 05, the page title — because reading the
            portfolio before the call is the whole product. "Look" is a glance,
            and it was the last verb before the two buttons.

            "You book" and "You decide" described the process for the fourth
            time on one page, after the six steps and the FAQ have both covered
            it. Somebody who has read this far does not need the order of
            events again; they need the last objection answered. So the second
            clause answers it: no, this is not a sales call. That promise fell
            off the hero when the sub-headline went, and it does more work here
            than it ever did there.

            Two clauses, not three. The first draft kept the triple and ran to
            67 characters, which wrapped as "You talk it / through" — a line
            that breaks inside a clause is worse than a line that is short.

            A span per sentence so the only place this can break is between
            them. Left to itself it wrapped as "They read it first. Nobody /
            sells you anything." at 375 — measured, not guessed: the two line
            boxes came back 196px and 147px, and the first sentence is the
            shorter of the two, so the break could not have been at the stop.
