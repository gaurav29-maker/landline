/**
 * The last resort, and the one page that cannot use anything the rest of the
 * site has.
 *
 * app/error.tsx catches a fault inside the root layout's children. It cannot
 * catch a fault in the root layout itself — if that throws, there is no
 * layout to render an error page into. React swaps the whole document for
 * this one, which is why it declares its own <html> and <body>: it REPLACES
 * the root layout rather than rendering inside it.
 *
 * That also means globals.css is not loaded, the fonts are not loaded, and
 * SiteNav and SiteFooter would drag in styles that no longer exist. So every
 * value here is inline and literal on purpose. It is the one file in the
 * project that must not import the design system, because the reason it is
 * showing may be that the design system failed to load.
 *
 * It should effectively never appear. It exists so that when it does, the
 * page still says something true instead of showing the browser's own error.
