 * Until now a 404 rendered Next's default: black text on white, no nav, no
 * footer, no way back into the site. The link checker added last week stops
 * us shipping a broken link; it does nothing about the ways people actually
 * arrive here — a mistyped address, a link from somewhere old, or an emailed
 * booking link opened long after the booking finished.
 *
 * That last one is the reason this page names the console. Someone who has
 * paid and cannot find their session needs somewhere to go, not an apology.
