/**
 * /experts reads every live expert and then computes each one's next open
 * slot. Until now the browser held the previous page for the whole of that
 * and then swapped — which locally is imperceptible and on a cold serverless
 * function against Postgres in Mumbai is not.
 *
 * The nav and footer are repeated here rather than left out. They live in the
 * page rather than a layout, so a skeleton without them would take the site
 * chrome away and put it back, which reads as a worse fault than the wait.
 *
 * Three cards because three is what is seeded. It is a placeholder, not a
 * promise about how many there are.
