 *
 * Measured on this exact code path, 40 runs of the sequence below:
 *
 *   plain update        5/40 and 1/40 runs left the row un-rejected
 *   update + confirm    0/40 and 0/40, never needing more than one retry

 * (0/25, against 19/25 over the socket), so the fault is the socket server
 * and not PGlite, Postgres or this codebase. Production talks to a real
 * Postgres over a real wire protocol and cannot do this, which is why the
 * confirmation is here — in the one place that provokes an error and then
 * depends on the next statement — rather than in lib/db.
 *
 * Two things to know if this ever looks wrong again. It presents as an
 * UPDATE matching zero rows against a row a SELECT returns one line later,
 * which sends you to the index, the collation and the parameter binding;
 * all three are fine, and the fault is in the statement BEFORE the one
